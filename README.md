A project with the aim of building a programming language that is as 'correct' and type-safe as Haskell or Rust, while being as convenient and intuitive as Go.

The language will not necessarily be called Cuttlefish--I just needed a repo name.

## Next

- Set up union/enum for constructor type
- Enable destructuring tuples and constructors
