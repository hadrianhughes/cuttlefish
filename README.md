A project with the aim of building a programming language that is as 'correct' and type-safe as Haskell or Rust, while being as convenient and intuitive as Go.

The language will not necessarily be called Cuttlefish--I just needed a repo name.

## TODO

- Require that type parameters be declared in angle brackets
- Add lambda expressions
- Check that type constraints correspond to existing classes
